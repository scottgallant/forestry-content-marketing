# Why I switched from WordPress to Jekyll

### Quick Outline

**Intro**
While this article will focus specifically on my switch from WordPress to Jekyll as my primary blogging and  
web development platform, it also meant to be a reflection of the growing migration away from dynamic, database-driven  
CMSs to static websites.

**Other Notes / Possible Things to Add**
* Is this regretion, or return to "simpler times?"
* Multiple reasons for going static:  
 1. Security (see Scott's email for ideas)  
 2. Speed (see Scott's email for ideas)  
 3. Simplicity (cite some stuff from 'Static Sites go all Hollywood' by Phil Hawksworth)  
  * No need to update plugins all the time, etc.  
  * Oftentimes, all of the bells and whistles are _WAY_ too much for a project's needs  
 4. Scalability  
  * Free (or low cost) hosting options  
  * Can handle _LOTS_ of traffic without skipping a beat  
  * Templated approach to site creation allows for modular design / development  
 5. Etc.
