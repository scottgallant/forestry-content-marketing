# Why I Switched from WordPress to Jekyll

### Quick Outline

**Intro**  
While this article will focus specifically on my switch from WordPress to Jekyll as my primary blogging and  
web development platform, it also meant to be a reflection of the growing migration - particularly among developers - away from dynamic, database-driven CMSs to static websites.

**My Background with WordPress and Why I Started Looking for Something New**  
Professionally, I've been working in the digital marketing realm since 2007. I can remember the glory days of stuffing hundreds of hidden keywords in a site's footer and buying links from Digital Point forums (shhh, don't tell Google).

**Bringing Static Back**  
I'm a pretty basic, "no-frills" kind of guy. I enjoy minimalist design. My favorite ice cream is vanilla. And I like when things work the way I expect - the first time, and every time after. And as I dove deeper down the rabbit hole of front end development, it was the simplicity and stability of being able to create things with nothing more than a little markup and JavaScript that got me thinking, "Is it feasible to develop websites this way today?"  

Enter Static Site Generators (or SSGs). Simply put, an SSG is a templating engine that takes text, assets, and various other files and spits out static html webpages. Because many modern SSGs utilize templates (e.g. includes, layaouts, etc.), support the use of Markdown and Meta Data, and include an asset pipeline (among many other features), they facilitation the development of fast, simple, large-scale websites without having to rely on a dynamic CMS like WordPress.  

There are currently [437 Static Site Generators](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) available for use. So why Jekyll? For starters, Jekyll is extremely popular. 

**Conclusion**  


**Other Notes / Possible Things to Add**
* Is this regression, or return to "simpler times?" Maybe a bit of both...  
* Multiple reasons for going static:  
 1. **Security** (see Scott's email for ideas)  
  * _LOTS_ of vulnerability's when it comes to WP (and other dynamic CMSs like Drupal, etc.)
   * Security holes come from plugins, MySQL databases, login interface, images, malicious search queries, etc.  
    * Constant updates, security plugins, anti-virus programs, etc. are often necessary to keep WP secure  
 2. **Speed** (see Scott's email for ideas)  
  * Database queries, code bloat, the need for multiple plugins, etc.
 3. **Simplicity** (cite some stuff from 'Static Sites go all Hollywood' by Phil Hawksworth)  
  * With static sites, there's no need to update plugins, themes, etc. all the time  
  * Oftentimes, all of the bells and whistles are _WAY_ too much for a project's needs  
  * Out of the box WordPress install almost always require further configuration and customization  
 4. **Scalability**  
  * Free (or low cost) hosting options  
  * Can handle _LOTS_ of traffic without skipping a beat  
  * Templated approach to site creation allows for modular design / development  
 5. **Etc.**
