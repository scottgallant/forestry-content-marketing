### Quick Outline

**Other Notes / Possible Things to Add**
* Is this regretion, or return to "simpler times?"
* Multiple reasons for going static:  
 1. Security (see Scott's email for ideas)  
 2. Speed (see Scott's email for ideas)  
 3. Simplicity (cite some stuff from 'Static Sites go all Hollywood' by Phil Hawksworth)  
 4. Etc.
